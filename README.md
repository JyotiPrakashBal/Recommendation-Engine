Recommendation Engine using Hybrid Filtering

A recommendation engine filters the data using different algorithms and recommends the most relevant items to users. It first captures the past behavior of a customer and based on that, recommends products which the users might be likely to buy.

Recommendation engines use a variety of technologies and techniques that enable them to filter large amounts of data and provide a smaller, focused body of suggestions for the user. Netflix, for example, uses metadata tagging on videos in conjunction with data about user behavior to come up with recommended movies and TV shows for specific members. LinkedIn uses the semi-structured data provided by members, including things like locations, job titles, skill sets and industries, to fuel their "Jobs you might be interested in" section. <br/> <br/>
The present study uses Hybrid Filtering- A system that combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to take advantage from both the representation of the content as well as the similarities among users. Although there are several ways in which to combine the two techniques a distinction can be made between two basis approaches. A hybrid approach combines the two types of information while it is also possible to use the recommendations of the two filtering techniques independently
